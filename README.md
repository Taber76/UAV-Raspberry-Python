# UAV
UAV for fire fighting

## Introcuction
This project consists of a UAV with a Pixhawk flight controller and a Raspberry Pi, which communicates through the mobile phone network with a cloud server, which can receive requests from a web client.
The UAV has a standard camera and a thermal one, to send live video and information about the ground temperature. The web client can generate a heat map and inform firefighters in real time.
Also in reconnaissance missions it can recognize smoke columns through AI and change your course to do closer reconnaissance.
The prototype under construction consists of an electrically powered flying wing. A minimum autonomy of 2 hours is estimated at a cruising speed of 70 km/h. Its range of action will depend on the coverage of the mobile phone network.
